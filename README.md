This is my version of the "**An Interactive Photo Gallery**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Frontend Web Development Techdegree**.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.
The png-images show how the gallery page and how the lightbox should look like.
